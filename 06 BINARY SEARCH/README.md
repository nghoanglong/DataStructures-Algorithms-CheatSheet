# Binary Search
## Python implementation
```
Search key x in list n elements which sorted
Time complexity: O(logn)
```

### find the position which matches target
```python
# left = 0 and right = len(li) - 1
# to catch problem about overflow, instead of using mid = (left + right) // 2
# we can handle it by using mid = left + (right - left) // 2
# and the result always in left or right position

def binary_search(left, right, li, target):
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    while left != mid and right != mid:
        if li[mid] >= target:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    if li[left] == target:
        return left
    elif li[right] == target:
        return right
    else:
        return -1
```

### find the first position which matches the target
The same code above. We can see that if li[mid] == target, we still move right close to the left until we reach the first position that matches the requirement

### find the last position which matches the target
```python
def binary_search(left, right, li, target):
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    while left != mid and right != mid:
        if li[mid] > target: # different with first match
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid
        mid = (left + right) // 2
    
    if li[right] == target:
        return left
    elif li[left] == target:
        return right
    else:
        return -1
```

## Python built-in function
Python doesnt have binary search built-in function, but it has some useful built-in function we can see here
### bisect.bisect_left(li, target, [left_subsequence, end_subsequence])
This function return position in the sorted list, where value at that position greater (>) or equal (=) the target. If the target greater than each of element in the list, the position will be equal **len(li) + 1**
```python
import bisect
if __name__ == '__main__':
    li = [2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8]
    res = bisect.bisect_left(li, 2, 0, len(li))
```

### bisect.bisect_right(li, target, [left_subsequence, end_subsequence])
This function return position in the sorted list, where value at that position greater (>) than the target. If the target greater than each of element in the list, the position will be equal **len(li) + 1**
```python
import bisect 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    li = [2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8]
    res = bisect.bisect_right(li, 3, 0, len(li))
```
